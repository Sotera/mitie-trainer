"We will say 'yes' or 'no.' It's no longer sending a code."[:newline:][:newline:]The county's 7,200 retirees last week got a surprise extra pension payment, just a[:newline:]few days after regular January pension checks had been credited to the retirees'[:newline:]bank accounts. The county, its retirement system computer vendor and Wells Fargo[:newline:][:newline:][:newline:]                                                                                    124693[:newline:]bank are investigating exactly what went wrong. According to county officials, it[:newline:]boiled down to someone at Wells Fargo overriding a security password during a[:newline:]routine test of the pension payment system.[:newline:][:newline:]"We want a final step to be a human being authorizing" any pension payments,[:newline:]Schroeder said. "The human process in an electronic age. It's a final catch."[:newline:][:newline:]In addition, the county will check to ensure that money to cover any pension payout[:newline:]has been received by Wells Fargo, Schroeder said. That didn't happen last week[:newline:]when the bogus payments were authorized.[:newline:][:newline:]Wells Fargo spokesman Jim Seitz said the bank "took immediate action" when it[:newline:]learned of the mistaken payments and had determined the cause of the problem. He[:newline:]declined to elaborate, citing client confidentiality.[:newline:][:newline:]More than 98% of the $10?million in payments have been recovered through[:newline:]reversals by Wells Fargo, Schroeder said. Wells Fargo also is taking the lead in[:newline:]pursuing repayment of the remaining mistaken payments now lodged in other bank[:newline:]accounts or converted to cash, said David Arena, the county's employee benefits[:newline:]manager.[:newline:][:newline:]For anyone who still hasn't relinquished the undeserved extra payment, the[:newline:]remaining sum will be deducted from the next regular pension check at the end of[:newline:]this month, Arena said. County taxpayers and the Pension Board will not be out any[:newline:]money, he said.[:newline:][:newline:]Wells Fargo electronically routes pension payments to retirees' designated bank[:newline:]accounts. Vitech Systems Group maintains the county's $10 million computerized[:newline:]pension system launched about a year ago.[:newline:][:newline:]A detailed report on reasons the extra pension payment happened will be completed[:newline:]in about two weeks, Schroeder said.[:newline:][:newline:]About 100 retirees Wednesday morning at the county's annual Pension Board[:newline:]meeting were told the pension fund gained about 19% in 2009, finishing the year at[:newline:]nearly $1.8 billion. That figure includes nearly $400 million in borrowed money. In[:newline:]2008, the fund lost 22.4%, some $500 million, in the stock market decline.[:newline:][:newline:]Last March's $400 million pension obligation bond issue to bolster the county fund[:newline:]came at a crucial time, said Larry Langer, a financial consultant to the county. The[:newline:]county is paying about 6.2% in interest on the bonds and hopes to do better than[:newline:]that in investment earnings.[:newline:][:newline:]The borrowed money "helped secure the benefits of the retirement system a little[:newline:]bit," Langer said.[:newline:][:newline:]In response to a retiree question about the fate of pension funds if the county ever[:newline:]were to be dissolved or reorganized, assistant county corporation counsel Mark[:newline:]Grady said individuals' pensions were safe.[:newline:][:newline:]"If the county were completely abolished, your benefits are completely protected,"[:newline:]Grady said.[:newline:][:newline:][:newline:][:newline:]                                                                                 124694[:newline:]County Executive Scott Walker has suggested dissolving the county and parceling[:newline:]out its functions to other governmental units.[:newline:][:newline:]Governor's race comes to Madison[:newline:]WKOW-TV - Madison[:newline:]By Jamie Hersch[:newline:]February 10, 2010[:newline:]http://www.wkowtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=11963525[:newline:][:newline:]MADISON (WKOW) -- The three front-runners for Wisconsin governor campaigned to[:newline:]an audience of restaurateurs on Wednesday at the Monona Terrace.[:newline:][:newline:]Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker (R), former Congressman Mark[:newline:]Neumann (R) and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett (D) attended the Wisconsin[:newline:]Restaurant Association's Lobby Day.[:newline:][:newline:]The campaign message was loud and clear from the three governor hopefuls: job[:newline:]creation is a top priority.[:newline:][:newline:]Restaurant owners say the candidates are preaching to the choir. If anyone knows[:newline:]we need to create jobs, it's these people.[:newline:][:newline:]"Getting people to come out to the restaurant is tough. Right now getting people out[:newline:]to where they can dine and use restaurants for business and pleasure, that's our[:newline:]goal," said John Kavanaugh, owner of Kavanaugh's Esquire Club.[:newline:][:newline:]These restaurant owners are curious to know how these candidates plan to create[:newline:]jobs.[:newline:][:newline:]Scott Walker says his campaign will bring the change Wisconsin needs.[:newline:][:newline:]"Enough is enough. It's time to get government out of the way so the private sector[:newline:]can actually move this state forward. If you believe over the last eight years that Jim[:newline:]Doyle has put this state in a better business climate than we had before, then you[:newline:]should elect Tom Barrett as your next governor, because you're going to get four[:newline:]more years of the same thing," said Walker.[:newline:][:newline:]But Barrett says that's not true. Instead, he's ready to cut into Wisconsin's massive[:newline:]debt.[:newline:][:newline:]"Would you rather have someone who's going to belly up to the bar and pay? Or are[:newline:]you going to prefer someone who's going to say let's have our kids and grandkids[:newline:]pay for it?" asked Barrett.[:newline:][:newline:]Mark Neumann made an appeal to the small business owners on a personal level.[:newline:][:newline:]"You want to make a statement to businesses across America? Put a private sector[:newline:]business person in the governor's seat as opposed to somebody whose background[:newline:]is in politics, and you will have made your first loud statetment to businesses around[:newline:]the world that we're interested in improving our business climate here," said[:newline:]Neumann.[:newline:][:newline:]Kavanaugh says all three candidates share his priority of jump-starting the economy,[:newline:][:newline:][:newline:]                                                                                 124695[:newline:]and he thinks it's going to be a tight race.[:newline:][:newline:]"I don't think right now you can blindly go for one candidate. I think you need to[:newline:]pay attention because there's a lot more at stake now than some years," said[:newline:]Kavanaugh.[:newline:][:newline:]Opinion: Politicians fear dealing with flakes[:newline:]Milwaukee Journal Sentinel[:newline:]By Eugene Kane[:newline:]February 11, 2010[:newline:]http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/84079517.html[:newline:][:newline:]In an election year, some candidates nervously look to the skies in wintertime and[:newline:]just hope for the best.[:newline:][:newline:]Chances are both Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and Milwaukee County Executive[:newline:]Scott Walker were doing the same thing during this week's snowstorm.[:newline:][:newline:]Both men are running for governor this fall. And both probably know the politics of[:newline:]snow removal could play a part in their respective campaigns.[:newline:][:newline:]The buck largely stops with them in terms of the government response to a massive[:newline:]snow removal necessary to clear roads and to dig out hundreds of thousands of[:newline:]Milwaukee-area residents in a reasonable amount of time.[:newline:][:newline:]Both men also are probably keenly aware the road to political victory is littered with[:newline:]elected officials who didn't respond quickly or efficiently enough to the snow-removal[:newline:]challenge. If there's any doubt how big a factor snow can play in the fortunes of[:newline:]candidates, just ask former mayors Marion Barry of Washington, D.C., Michael[:newline:]Bilandic of Chicago or John Lindsay of New York.[:newline:][:newline:]All had political careers damaged or derailed because of a big snowstorm that hit[:newline:]their cities before an important election.[:newline:][:newline:]Most politicians have more sense than Barry, who was out of town attending a Super[:newline:]Bowl in California in 1987 during a huge blizzard that shut down the nation's capital.[:newline:]Barry, of course, had other problems that led to his demise.[:newline:][:newline:]Bilandic lost his race in the 1979 Democratic primary to Jane Byrne after being[:newline:]perceived as lacking in his efforts to respond to a paralyzing winter storm in[:newline:]Chicago. Lindsay was weakened politically after a massive blizzard in 1969 that[:newline:]prompted claims he favored Manhattanites over other New Yorkers and almost lost[:newline:]his next election.[:newline:][:newline:]As these examples show, a city's mayor frequently seems to bear the brunt of[:newline:]political snow issues. That's why Barrett has more to lose if the Milwaukee cleanup[:newline:]doesn't meet standards, particularly in low-income neighborhoods that seem to be[:newline:]last on the list for attention from the snowplows.[:newline:][:newline:]It's likely Walker won't catch as much heat on this issue as Barrett because the[:newline:]county's responsibility to clear snow isn't as daunting as the city's. But if Walker's[:newline:]stringent budget policies translate into less money for snow removal, he also could[:newline:]be faulted if things are perceived as moving too slowly.[:newline:][:newline:][:newline:]                                                                                   124696[:newline:]The county executive also probably wouldn't mind if Milwaukeeans stayed[:newline:]snowbound for awhile, because it would give him a good campaign issue to use[:newline:]against Barrett.[:newline:][:newline:]Most residents understand Mother Nature isn't a Democrat or a Republican, even as[:newline:]people view the global warming debate through a political lens.[:newline:][:newline:](Can you believe some politicians actually believe a big snowstorm somehow proves[:newline:]there is no global warming? Didn't these people have science in high school?)[:newline:][:newline:]City ordinances require prompt shoveling of pavements, but some homeowners do a[:newline:]poor job of following the rules. Homeowners can be ticketed and fined if they don't[:newline:]respond to the snow.

It comes less than two weeks after[:newline:]Assembly Speaker Mike Sheridan admitted dating a lobbyist for the industry.[:newline:][:newline:]The plan would not put any cap on the annual interest rates that lenders could[:newline:]charge on loans, unlike a previous bill that would have limited them to 36 percent.[:newline:][:newline:]But lenders would be barred from "rolling over" a customer's outstanding loan into a[:newline:]new, larger loan, a practice that critics say traps the poor in a crushing debt cycle.[:newline:][:newline:]Lenders would also have to consider a person's ability to pay back their debt.[:newline:][:newline:]"Right now, loans are made with no consideration of income, reasonable payment[:newline:]terms, and no limits on the number of loans and the ability to roll them over, and no[:newline:]end to the total debt cycle," said Rep. Gordon Hintz, a Democrat from Oshkosh.[:newline:][:newline:]Rep. Andy Jorgensen, a Democrat from Fort Atkinson, agreed.[:newline:][:newline:]"Ninety percent of the revenue generated by payday lenders comes through[:newline:]rollovers. This bill stops that cycle in its tracks," Jorgensen said.[:newline:][:newline:]The bill also bans the use of title loans as collateral.[:newline:][:newline:][:newline:][:newline:]                                                                                 124697[:newline:]The payday lending industry in Wisconsin has been largely unregulated. In 2008,[:newline:]there were 530 payday loan stores in the state, WISC-TV reported.[:newline:][:newline:]Sponsors of the bill acknowledged Assembly Speaker Mike Sheridan's admitted[:newline:]relationship with a payday loan industry lobbyist was a distraction, but said Sheridan[:newline:]was not involved in the new bill's details.[:newline:][:newline:]Sheridan released a statement saying he supports the bill and plans to bring it to the[:newline:]floor for a vote as soon as possible.[:newline:][:newline:]City of Fond du Lac employees accused of embezzling more than $100,000[:newline:]Fond du Lac Reporter[:newline:]By Russell Plummer[:newline:]February 11, 2010[:newline:]http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20100211/FON0101/2110384/1985/City-of-Fond-[:newline:]du-Lac-employees-accused-of-embezzling-more-than-100-000[:newline:][:newline:]Three City of Fond du Lac Management Information Systems (MIS) department[:newline:]employees have been stripped of their duties following accusations they embezzled[:newline:]more than $100,000 from taxpayers.[:newline:][:newline:]The three suspects plus a former employee and an electronics vendor allegedly[:newline:]worked together to commit a fraudulent ordering and invoicing scheme over a period[:newline:]of at least five years, said Fond du Lac County District Attorney Dan Kaminsky on[:newline:]Wednesday.[:newline:][:newline:]Investigators executed search warrants Tuesday on the Fond du Lac employees[:newline:]believed to be engaged in the scheme to bilk the city of funds and receive property[:newline:]unlawfully, said Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen.[:newline:][:newline:]The three employees are on paid administrative leave while the investigation is[:newline:]continuing, said City Manager Tom Herre.[:newline:]Allegations detailed[:newline:][:newline:]According to the allegations leveled against the suspects:[:newline:][:newline:]The employees would place an order through an outside vendor, and the vendor[:newline:]would invoice the city, claiming the order was generic labor or services, Kaminsky[:newline:]said.[:newline:][:newline:]"It was the vendor who was forging the invoices. Those invoices would get approved[:newline:]through the IT department ? the (same) people ordering the stuff in the first place,"[:newline:]Kaminsky said.[:newline:][:newline:]He added that the vendor was questioned Tuesday, and charges are expected to be[:newline:]filed against him.[:newline:][:newline:]Surplus parts belonging to the city may have been taken for personal use and/or[:newline:]sold for personal profit, Kaminsky said.[:newline:][:newline:]More suspects ? including additional vendors ? may arise as the investigation[:newline:]continues, said Kaminsky.[:newline:][:newline:][:newline:]                                                                                  124698[:newline:]The confidential informant just wanted to be honest in reporting what that person[:newline:]felt could be wrongdoing, he added.[:newline:][:newline:]"(The informant) didn't want to work in an environment where those types of[:newline:]activities were going on," Kaminsky said.[:newline:]Search warrants[:newline:][:newline:]Search warrants are sealed and may not be opened until charges are filed, said[:newline:]North Fond du Lac Police Chief Bill Lamb, whose police force acted as special[:newline:]investigators at the request of Fond du Lac Police Chief Tony Barthuly.[:newline:]Kaminsky said he expects that it will be several weeks before charges are filed.[:newline:][:newline:]"To have everything go public and the employees removed was a strategic decision,"[:newline:]Kaminsky said. "We still have a continuing investigation. We want to make sure we[:newline:]have all of the information before we file charges."[:newline:][:newline:]Human Resources Director Rodney Pasch, who will temporarily fill the role of MIS[:newline:]director, said he could not comment on who is currently employed at the MIS[:newline:]department because of an ongoing internal human resources investigation.[:newline:][:newline:]The MIS department listing has been removed from the City of Fond du Lac Web[:newline:]site. Herre said the MIS department has four employees.[:newline:][:newline:]Calls Wednesday to the work numbers of longtime MIS Director Mark Beveridge and[:newline:]MIS employees Jason Wianecki and Jon Lippert went unanswered. No voicemails[:newline:]were recorded for the three men.[:newline:][:newline:]Another MIS employee answered the MIS department work phone but declined to[:newline:]comment.[:newline:]Investigation[:newline:][:newline:]Detective Sgt. Brian Liethen of the North Fond du Lac Police Department[:newline:]spearheaded the investigation that began in late 2009 after a confidential informant[:newline:]alerted officials of suspected fraud.[:newline:][:newline:]"Obviously, I was very concerned and immediately thought it was time to implement[:newline:]an outside agency to investigate this," Barthuly said.[:newline:][:newline:]Besides a conflict with the Fond du Lac Police Department investigating city officials,[:newline:]the Management Information Systems department has access to e-mails and[:newline:]electronic correspondence at the Police Department, Kaminsky said.[:newline:][:newline:]Wednesday's operation involved the joint efforts of more than 40 law enforcement[:newline:]officials, including both local officers and special agents of the Wisconsin Department[:newline:]of Justice (DOJ). The investigation spans five counties, said Lamb.[:newline:][:newline:]"You're talking about a truly sophisticated criminal conspiracy and network," Lamb[:newline:]said. "We have a lot of t's to cross and i's to dot."[:newline:][:newline:]Twenty-eight special agents and analysts from the Department of Justice worked on[:newline:]the case at some point, said Van Hollen.[:newline:][:newline:]"We are very fortunate for the swift and concise efforts of law enforcement and the[:newline:][:newline:][:newline:]                                                                                   124699[:newline:]bravery of the confidential informant. Working together with City Manager Tom[:newline:]Herre, not only has the investigation progressed, but I believe everything has been[:newline:]done to minimize disruption in city operations," Kaminksy said. "Absent these[:newline:]coordinated efforts, the alleged criminal activities of these suspects may have[:newline:]continued to go unnoticed, costing taxpayers thousands of dollars more than what is[:newline:]already believed to have been stolen."[:newline:][:newline:]Kaminsky said he does not expect to seek a special prosecutor since he has never[:newline:]had contact with the alleged suspects, and the MIS department does not have[:newline:]access to any of his office computers. The Division of Legal Services in the DOJ will[:newline:]assist Kaminsky.[:newline:][:newline:]Potential charges include embezzlement, fraud involving forgery and uttering of[:newline:]forgery, misconduct in public office, receiving stolen property and aiding a felon,[:newline:]Kaminsky said.[:newline:][:newline:]Iran Claims Nuclear Gain as Protesters Clash[:newline:]New York Times[:newline:]By ALAN COWELL and MICHAEL SLACKMAN[:newline:]February 11, 2010[:newline:]http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/world/middleeast/12iran.html?[:newline:]partner=rssnyt&emc=rss[:newline:][:newline:]As security forces clashed with his opponents, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of[:newline:]Iran was quoted on Thursday as saying his country had produced a first batch of[:newline:]uranium enriched to a level of 20 percent, taunting the West by declaring that if[:newline:]Tehran wanted to build a nuclear bomb, it would say so.[:newline:][:newline:]Iran, he said, repeating an earlier assertion, was now ?a nuclear state.? Mr.[:newline:]Ahmadinejad?s claims could not be independently verified.[:newline:][:newline:]Mr. Ahmadinejad chose a major political event ? the 31st anniversary of the Islamic[:newline:]Revolution ? to announce what he depicted as significant progress in his country?s[:newline:]nuclear program. The setting reflected the central role played by Iran?s nuclear[:newline:]program in domestic politics as Tehran confronts its worst political crisis since the fall[:newline:]of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1979.[:newline:][:newline:]As he spoke, opposition Web sites carried reports of a crackdown on antigovernment[:newline:]protesters as the anniversary celebrations unfolded, with accounts of gunfire, tear[:newline:]gas and attacks on opposition leaders. Videos posted online showed protesters[:newline:]calling for the release of political prisoners and carrying green banners ? the color of[:newline:]the opposition ? through the streets.[:newline:][:newline:]The reports and authenticity of the videos could not be confirmed independently[:newline:]because the Iranian authorities imposed severe restrictions on news coverage after[:newline:]last June?s flawed presidential elections. News reports said pro-government Iranians[:newline:]gathered to hear Mr. Ahmadinejad outnumbered his opponents who faced a[:newline:]crackdown by security forces that broke up many attempts to protest.[:newline:][:newline:]Mr. Ahmadinejad again denied that Tehran was seeking nuclear weapons. ?When we[:newline:]say we do not manufacture the bomb, we mean it, and we do not believe in[:newline:]manufacturing a bomb,? Mr. Ahmadinejad told the crowd, according to news reports.[:newline:][:newline:][:newline:]                                                                                    124700[:newline:]He continued: ?The Iranian nation is brave enough that if one day we wanted to[:newline:]build nuclear bombs we would announce it publicly without being afraid of you.?[:newline:][:newline:]It was unclear whether Mr. Ahmadinejad?s comments represented gamesmanship or[:newline:]a step toward acknowledging the suspicions that it is pursuing a weapons program.[:newline:][:newline:]Brushing aside Western threats of more stringent sanctions, Mr. Ahmadinejad was[:newline:]addressing a huge rally of supporters in Tehran?s Azadi Square, claiming that[:newline:]Tehran could now enrich to much higher levels and would soon triple its output of[:newline:]20-percent-enriched uranium.[:newline:][:newline:]Western experts have already said that once Iran was able to enrich uranium to 20[:newline:]percent it could theoretically move relatively quickly toward the manufacture of[:newline:]weapons-grade fuel, usually reckoned at 90 percent.[:newline:][:newline:]The anniversary of the 1979 revolution has become a test of strength between Mr.[:newline:]Ahmadinejad and an opposition movement that took root after the elections,[:newline:]creating the biggest political challenge since the fall of the shah.[:newline:][:newline:]Apart from the crackdown on the streets, the authorities on Wednesday drastically[:newline:]slowed Internet service in Iran and shut down text messaging services. One official[:newline:]said that Gmail, the Google e-mail service, would be blocked.[:newline:][:newline:]But news reports and opposition Web sites indicated that protesters still turned out[:newline:]in Tehran and the Iranian cities of Shiraz, Ahwaz and Isfahan.[:newline:][:newline:]An Iranian opposition Web site said security forces fired shots and tear gas at[:newline:]supporters of an opposition leader, Mir Hussein Moussavi, as they mounted a[:newline:]counter-rally in central Tehran.[:newline:][:newline:]?Security forces opened fired at protesters and fired tear gas in central Tehran,?[:newline:]Reuters quoted the Green Voice Web site as saying, citing witnesses. Another[:newline:]opposition Web site, Jaras, said that security forces attacked the car of another[:newline:]opposition leader, Mehdi Karroubi, as he was heading to a rally marking the[:newline:]anniversary.[:newline:][:newline:]Jaras also said security forces attacked former President Mohammad Khatami and[:newline:]briefly arrested his brother and his brother?s wife, who is a granddaughter of[:newline:]Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Revolution.[:newline:][:newline:]The authorities had warned that they intended to confront protesters harshly.[:newline:]Witnesses quoted by The A.P. said the police deployed hundreds of officers in[:newline:]central Tehran to block protests.[:newline:][:newline:]The confluence of the protests and Mr. Ahmadinejad?s nuclear claims offered a[:newline:]graphic illustration of how much Iran?s foreign policy is being driven by domestic[:newline:]concerns, analysts said.[:newline:][:newline:]?Right now at Natanz we have the capability to enrich uranium to much higher[:newline:]levels,? Mr. Ahmadinejad said, referring to Iran?s nuclear facility south of Tehran,[:newline:]according to news reports.[:newline:][:newline:]?I want to announce with a loud voice here that the first package of 20 percent fuel[:newline:][:newline:][:newline:]                                                                                  124701[:newline:]was produced and provided to the scientists,? he said. ?In the near future we will[:newline:]treble its production,? Mr. Ahmadinejad said.[:newline:][:newline:]He continued: ?We have the capability to enrich uranium more than 20 percent or[:newline:]80 percent,? he said, according to news reports, but added that Iran did not need to[:newline:]do that. His speech was broadcast live on state television.[:newline:][:newline:]Mr. Ahmadinejad?s remarks followed Iran?s announcement on Monday that it would[:newline:]begin enrichment to 20 percent, ostensibly to provide fuel for a medical reactor in[:newline:]Tehran.[:newline:][:newline:]The response in the West was an increased clamor for the imposition of sanctions[:newline:]that would target the Revolutionary Guards Corps in particular. The United States[:newline:]Treasury Department imposed unilateral sanctions on Wednesday against a corps[:newline:]commander and four companies linked to the organization.[:newline:][:newline:]Iran?s newest enrichment effort took place partly in the presence of inspectors from[:newline:]the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear oversight body.[:newline:]But I.A.E.A. officials said Thursday they could not confirm the Iranian claim that the[:newline:]enrichment process had been successful.[:newline:][:newline:]Western experts noted that even if Iran possessed 20-percent-enriched fuel, that did[:newline:]not mean it could be used in a reactor without being converted into fuel rods.[:newline:][:newline:]In a note distributed to the agency?s member states late Wednesday, the director[:newline:]general, Yukiya Amano, said that when the inspectors arrived at Natanz on[:newline:]Wednesday, they were informed that Iran had already begun to feed low-enriched[:newline:]uranium into a cascade of centrifuges for enrichment.[:newline:][:newline:]The inspectors were told that ?within a few days? Iran would produce uranium[:newline:]enriched at 20 percent, the note said, according to diplomats who saw it. Iran had[:newline:]told the agency that the amount of low-enriched uranium to be processed was[:newline:]small, around 22 pounds. Iran currently possesses only one cascade capable of[:newline:]enriching to a level of 20 percent, the note said.[:newline:][:newline:]Iran began its enrichment effort after a deal last October to swap low-enriched[:newline:]uranium for fuel rods from abroad apparently broke down. The agreement foundered[:newline:]partly on disputes over the timing of the exchange, with Iran insisting that the swap[:newline:]take place simultaneously on Iranian soil while international powers wanted Iran to[:newline:]export its stockpile for reprocessing into fuel rods to be returned to Iran later. That[:newline:]would have temporarily deprived Iran of the raw material for enrichment.[:newline:][:newline:]Iran has insisted in recent days that the deal is still on the table, but Western[:newline:]diplomats familiar with the dispute said the Iranian position was part of the[:newline:]diplomatic maneuvering to prevent China in particular from supporting the Western[:newline:]demand for tighter United Nations sanctions.[:newline:][:newline:]Alan Cowell reported from Paris, and Michael Slackman from Cairo. Reporting was[:newline:]contributed by Nazila Fathi from Toronto, Neil MacFarquhar from New York, and[:newline:]Ashlee Vance from San Francisco.[:newline:][:newline:][:newline:][:newline:][:newline:]                                                                                 124702[:newline:]
